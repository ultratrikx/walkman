# NFC Walkman Music Player

## Inspo

Loved the walkman era and all the casette tapes so I decided to make my own modern version of one to play my playlists while I lock-in and do my work.

## Cool Features + Spec List

-   Raspi Pico W2 controller
-   RN532 NFC tag reader
-   NFC Stickers
-   0.91" OLED display

Connects with my homeassistant server so that whenever a particular cassette with a NFC sticker is inserted, it reads it and then plays the correct playlist on my speakers using homeassistant. Current 3D printed case is a temporary until I can thrift an actual cassete player which I will then gut out and replace the electronics with my current setup.

## Build Plan

1. 3D Print case
2. Connect electronics together
3. Build + customize + decorate case
4. upload custom firmware
5. listen to fire music
